The MojoV3 bootloader you get may or may not be
the right one that will work from Arduino IDE 1.6
If you try to upload the 'loader' sketch and it
never seems to find the device, then you will
likely have to upload a new bootloader.

If not, you have to upload the bootloader from
Arduino IDE.  

First compile ArduinoISP and flash that to an Uno

Then solder wires to the underside of the MojoV3
board 6 pins.

When 6 pins are in top right corner of board,
and pins are in a 3 accross and 2 down grid, 
pins are as follows:

GND MOSI VDD 
RST CLK  MISO

Wire these up to the Aruino Uno according to pins
in the src file.

Then switch project to the loader project.  Make sure
the programmer is changed to ArduinoISP and select
the right COM port.  Then chose upload bootloader.

You should not need to power the MojoV3 separately.
It will get powered by the Arduino when wired.

After the bootloader is uploaded, unhook the
ISP wires from the MojoV3.  You can then plug
the MojoV3 in via USB and then upload the sketch
for the loader program.  But remember to change
the programmer back to ISPMarkII.  This step
should also not require separate power supply.

Now that both the boot loader and loader is installed,
you can use the mojo loader to upload the bistream.
