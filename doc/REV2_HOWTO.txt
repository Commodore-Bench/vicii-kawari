Some notes about REV2 board with W25Q16 flash chip.
This configuration loads the bitstream from flash and you need
to use ISE Impact to program via the JTAG header.

!!! Must add this to .bashrc for ISE 14.7 
export XIL_IMPACT_SKIPIDCODECHECK="1"
(This will take effect on next boot)

This tells Impact to ignore the IDCODE check.  Otherwise, the SPI
flash chip will not match what it expects.  But W25Q16 will work.

To make a PROM:
1. Run impact and select Generate PROM
2. Add the top.bit (lots of wasted space)
3. Save

To program
1. Initialize JTAG chain
2. Boundary scan
3. Add SPI flash device
4. Select W25Q16
5. Program

Must re-create PROM (.mcs) file after every new bitstream?
Sometimes Impact will crash loading the project
Just launch from desktop icon and it will ask you if you want to load last
project.  Say no and start from scratch.


Remember to go to Process Properties (when Generate Programming File is selected in Project Navigator) and turn on SPI bus width 4!  This enables quad SPI
programming.
